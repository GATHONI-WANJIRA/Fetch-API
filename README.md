####  DESCRIPTION. 

- Some of the common APIs that you are likely to run into is REST APIs on the web and LIbrary APIs from code that you pull in to your project locally.  


 - #### Web APIs (REST APIs).  
    - They provide certain endpoints (URLs) which you can access to get certain data from that API. 
    - You can also use the endpoints to be able to modify certain data from the API selectively.


- #### Library APIs.  
   - This are actual libraries that you pull into the code and they have a bunch of different methods defined on them that do specific tasks and return required data.
